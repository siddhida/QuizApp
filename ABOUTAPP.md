**1. Architecture Overview:**
   - The system comprises a web server and a database.
   - Users access the quiz through a web application on their devices, and their interactions are independent.

**2. Components:**

   a. **Web Server:**
      - The web server handles user requests, serves the quiz application, and maintains the quiz state for individual users.
      - It interacts with the database for question retrieval and score recording.
      - Implements a timer mechanism for each question and user.

   b. **Database:**
      - The database stores user profiles, quiz questions, and user responses.
      - User profiles include information like usernames, scores, and unique identifiers.
      - Quiz questions are stored with options, correct answers, and question identifiers.
      - User responses are logged to track scores.

**3. Workflow:**

   a. **User Registration and Authentication:**
      - Users can register with a username and password or log in using an existing account.
      - Upon successful authentication, users are assigned a unique session token.

   b. **Quiz Setup:**
      - After logging in, users are presented with a QR code to access the quiz.
      - The QR code contains a unique identifier for the quiz session.

   c. **Quiz Interaction:**
      - Users enter their name and click "Start" to initiate the quiz.
      - The web server serves the quiz questions one by one.
      - Each question is accompanied by a timer set for 20 seconds.

   d. **Question Transitions:**
      - When the timer expires, the web server automatically serves the next question.
      - If a user answers the question and clicks "Next" or "Skip," the next question is immediately served to that user.

   e. **Scoring:**
      - The server calculates the user's score based on their correct answers.
      - Users are presented with their scores at the end of the quiz.

   f. **Leaderboard:** (Optional)
      - The system maintains a leaderboard of the top scorers in real-time.
      - Users can view their ranking among other participants.

**4. Technologies:**
   - **Web Server:** Node.js with Express.js for the server.
   - **Database:** MongoDB for storing user profiles, questions, and responses.
   - **Frontend:** React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the user interfaces.
   - **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication.

**5. Scalability and Performance:**
   - The system should be designed for horizontal scalability to handle a large number of concurrent users.
   - Implement caching mechanisms to reduce the load on the database, especially for frequently accessed data.

**6. Security:**
   - Ensure data security by implementing proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
   - Protect against common web application security vulnerabilities, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

This revised system design accounts for a non-multiplayer quiz where each user operates independently with a timer. The timer mechanism for question transitions is simplified, and users can proceed to the next question by clicking the "Next" or "Skip" button. Implementation details, including database schema and server code, would be needed to fully realize this system.


Schema Design

To design the schema and context for the quiz application, we'll define the database schema and provide an overview of the context and interactions between various components. In this case, we'll assume a simple schema using MongoDB as the database.

**Database Schema:**

1. **User Profiles:**
   - Collection: `users`
   - Fields:
     - `_id` (ObjectId, unique identifier)
     - `username` (string, unique)
     - `password` (string, hashed and salted)
     - `created_at` (timestamp, registration date)
     - `score` (integer)

2. **Quiz Questions:**
   - Collection: `questions`
   - Fields:
     - `_id` (ObjectId, unique identifier)
     - `text` (string, question text)
     - `options` (array of strings, answer options)
     - `correct_answer` (string, index of the correct answer option)
     - `created_at` (timestamp, creation date)

3. **User Responses:**
   - Collection: `responses`
   - Fields:
     - `_id` (ObjectId, unique identifier)
     - `user_id` (ObjectId, references a user)
     - `question_id` (ObjectId, references a question)
     - `selected_option` (string, index of the selected answer option)
     - `is_correct` (boolean, indicates whether the answer is correct)
     - `answered_at` (timestamp, time of response)

**Context and Interactions:**

1. **User Authentication:**
   - Users register or log in to the system.
   - The web server handles user authentication using JWT.
   - After successful authentication, users are issued a JWT token that they send with each request.

2. **Quiz Initialization:**
   - Users access the quiz by scanning a QR code.
   - The QR code includes a unique identifier for the quiz session.

3. **Quiz Interaction:**
   - When a user starts the quiz, the web server retrieves questions from the database one by one.
   - Each question is served with a 20-second timer.

4. **Question Transitions:**
   - When the timer expires, or if a user selects an answer and clicks "Next" or "Skip," the next question is served.

5. **Scoring:**
   - After each question, the server records the user's response and calculates their score.
   - User scores are updated in the user profiles in the database.

6. **Leaderboard:**(Optional)
   - The system maintains a leaderboard of top scorers in real-time.
   - Leaderboard data is updated based on user scores.

           |    MongoDB (Database)   |
           | +-----------------------+ |
           | |    Users Collection   | |
           | |   Questions Collection| |
           | |  Responses Collection | |
           | +-----------------------+ |
           +--------------------------+
```

In this context design, the web server serves as the central component, handling user authentication, quiz question serving, scoring, and leaderboard management. The MongoDB database stores user profiles, questions, and responses, supporting the data operations of the system.

This context design provides a structured overview of how different components interact to facilitate the quiz application's functionality. Implementation of server endpoints, database queries, and user interfaces will be required to fully realize the system.
